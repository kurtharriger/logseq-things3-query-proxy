# Logseq Query Service for Things 3 Database

Simple HTTP service to enable logseq Things 3 plugin (under development) running in sandbox to query Things 3 sqlite database

For now I just run in terminal before to query endpoint and the endpoint simply dumps all data I care about.  

TODO:
* run in system tray instead commandline 
* specify query instead of dumping all data
* investigate using webrtc to communicate with logseq instead of shared port estabishing initial connection using deep-linking url handler
  * deep linking https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38458857/electron-url-scheme-open-url-event
